# Web Frameworks Part 2

This is the continuation of HTTP Requests and Responses (a.k.a Web Frameworks Part 1).

Now that we have an idea of how HTTP works, and having seen a basic web application in action, it's time to take things to the next level with a larger web application.

We'll write a web application that has a layout, CSS, images, dynamic pages, dynamic routes, as well as  a database to store its data.
