## Good habits for avoiding bugs

- use IRB to try small bits of code out before introducing them to your program
- try out each method, class, etc as you go along
- keep trying the same things and watch for change in output
- use meaningful names for variables and methods
- write readable code
  - e.g. avoid ruby-specific syntax in favour of more universal syntax (push vs <<)
- keep your code DRY
- be consistent (spaces vs tabs)
- comment your code
- indentation
- plan your code (pseudocode)
- have an organized system of dependencies (what code relies on what other code)
- organize your code into separate files (e.g. one file per class)



## Debugging Techniques
- read the error message (to the end)
  - line number, stack trace, description of error
- split the code on to multiple lines/steps
- google the error message
  - stack overflow
- read your code
- ask for help
- pair programming
- use version control to revert to the last working version of your code
- try to break things intentionally (sanity check)
- printing things (puts variables, etc, .inspect to get more info)
