# Basics

# Write a method that takes someone's order

# Call the method

thing = def take_order(food)
  puts "You've ordered #{food}."
end

take_order('burger')

puts thing.inspect
send(thing, 'pizza')



items = ['hat', 'gloves', 'watch'];
items.each do |item|
  puts "The item is #{item}."
end


# Question:
# Can I assign it to a variable as a method? Why would I want to do this?
